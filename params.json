That's why StarBase is open source. You're welcome to fork StarBase and customise it for your own purposes. You will need a copy of the Python programming language and several third party modules for Python. These are:\r\n\r\n[Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/getit/)  \r\n[Pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)  \r\n[PySide-1.1](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Get-PySide) -  Qt GUI framework bindings for Python  \r\n[NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/download.html) â€“ a network graph library\r\n\r\nOptionally, if you wish to build the application as a Windows executable yourself, you will also need:\r\n\r\n[Py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/)  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nStarbase was written and is copyrighted (2013) by @simon-hibbs.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
