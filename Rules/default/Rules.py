DESCRIPTION = "A basic, default rules file for StarBase designed as " +\
              "a simple starting point for implementing custom rules sets."

# The log module provides services for writing to the application log file.
# Try not to over-use it as the log file will get spammy. To write a log entry
# call it like this:
# debug_log('My log message ' + str(some_interesting_value))
#
# Note that the single parameter to the debug_log function must be a string,
# so you can't treat it like a print function, with comma separated values.


# Convenience functions

def zd(n):
    # return a number from 0 to n inclusive
    return random.randint(0, n - 1)

def d6():
    # Return a number from 1 to 6 inclusive
    return random.randint(1, 6)


# World attributes such as 'Atmosphere', 'Technology', etc are each defined by
# a Python dictionary with the following keys:
# 'Name' :  The name of the attribute.
# 'Codes' : A list of one character codes used to identify discrete attribute
#           values. It is important because the codes in the 'Code data' dictionary
#           are unordered, so we need a way for the application to order the codes.
# 'Code Data': A dictionary with each key being a code. Each code references
#              a dictionary with two keys. 'Label' which is a short summary
#              of that code value used in buttons and drop-down lists, and
#              'Description' which is a more detailed explanation of what
#              that code means for use in text boxes and such. In tha App the
#              'Description' text can be customised for each world by the user.

# Note that the name of this variable 'atmo_data' itself isn't particularly significant.
